How it works
KafkaListener receives messages from Kafka and parses the JSON payload into a Message object.
MessageRouterService routes based on the uri field:
    /user/* → UserService methods
    /stock/* → StockService methods
    /subscription/* → SubscriptionService methods
    /ahp-config/* → AhpConfigService methods
The router deserializes the payload into the appropriate DTO and calls the corresponding service method.
